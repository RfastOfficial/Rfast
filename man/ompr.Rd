Orthogonal matching pursuit variable selection

\description{
Orthogonal matching pursuit variable selection.
}

\usage{
ompr(y, x, ystand = TRUE, xstand = TRUE, method = "BIC", tol = 2 )
omp(y, x, xstand = TRUE, tol = qchisq(0.95, 1) + log( length(y) ), type = "logistic" ) 
}

\arguments{
\item{y}{
The response variable, a numeric vector. For "ompr" this is a continuous variable.
For "omp" this can be either a vector with discrete (count) data, 0 and 1, non negative
values, strictly positive or proportions including 0 and 1.
}
\item{x}{
A matrix with the data, where the rows denote the observations and the columns are the variables. 
}
\item{ystand}{
If this is TRUE the response variable is centered. The mean is subtracted from every value.
}
\item{xstand}{
If this is TRUE the independent variables are standardised. 
}
\item{method}{
You can choose between the change in the BIC ("BIC"), the adjusted \eqn{R^2} ("ar2"),  
the SSE ("SSE") or the classical p-value based ("pvalue"). 
}
\item{tol}{
The tolerance value to terminate the algorithm. This is the change in the criterion value 
between two successive steps. For "ompr" the default value is 2 because the default method
is "BIC". For "omp" the default value is the 95\% quantile of the \eqn{\chi^2} distribution
with 1 degree of freedom plus the logarithm of the sample size.
}
\item{type}{
This denotes the parametric model to be used each time. It depends upon the nature of y. 
The possible values are "logistic", "poisson", "quasipoisson", "quasibinomial", "normlog",
"gamma", "weibull", "mv" (for multivariate response variable) or "multinomial".
}
}

\value{
For "ompr" a list including:
\item{runtime}{
The runtime of the algorithm.
}
\item{info}{
A matrix with two columns. The selected variable(s) and the criterion value at every step. 
}
For "omp" a list including:
\item{runtime}{
The runtime of the algorithm.
}
\item{phi}{
The \eqn{\phi} parameter. In the cases of "quasipoisson", "quasibinomial" and "normlog" this is useful. For all other cases this is NULL.
}
\item{info}{
A matrix with two columns. The selected variable(s) and the criterion value at every step. 
}
