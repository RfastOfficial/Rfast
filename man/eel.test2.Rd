Empirical and exponential empirical likelihood tests for two samples

\description{
Empirical and exponential empirical likelihood tests for two samples.
}

\usage{
eel.test2(x, y, tol = 1e-09, logged = FALSE)
el.test2(x, y, tol = 1e-07, logged = FALSE)
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{
A numerical vector. 
}
\item{y}{
Another numerical vector.
}
\item{tol}{
The tolerance value to stop the iterations of the Newton-Raphson.
}
\item{logged}{
Should the logarithm of the p-value be returned? TRUE or FALSE.
}
}

\details{
Empirical and exponential empirical likelihood are two non parametric hypothesis testing methods. We can use them as 
non parametric alternatives to the t-test. Newton-Raphson is used to maximise the log-likelihood ratio test statistic. 
In the case of no solution, NULL is returned.  
}

\value{
\item{iters}{
The number of iterations required by the Newton-Raphson algorithm. If no covnergence occured this is NULL.
}
\item{info}{
A vector with three elements, the value of the \eqn{\lambda}, the likelihood ratio test statistic and the relevant p-value.
If no convergence occured, the value of the \eqn{\lambda} before is becomes NA, the value of test statistic is \eqn{10^5} and the p-value is 0.
No convergence can be interpreted as rejection of the hypothesis test.
}
\item{p1}{
The estimated probabilities, one for each observation for the first sample. If no covnergence occured this is NULL.
}
\item{p2}{
The estimated probabilities, one for each observation for the second sample. If no covnergence occured this is NULL.
}
